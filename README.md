## Quick, Draw! Polymer Component & API

Embed [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) drawings into your project using a web component, as easily as:

```<quick-draw category="apple" key="API_KEY"></quick-draw>```  

This component is built using [Polymer3](https://www.polymer-project.org/) and is coupled with an API layer for accessing individual drawing data from the [open sourced data set](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).  The drawings are drawn out to a canvas element, and provides you with options to customize it for your own web project. [Here's a demo of how it can be used in different ways.](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/quickdraw-component/demo/)

### Background

In October 2016 we released [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com), a game to test your ability to doodle and have a neural net guess what you're drawing. You can help teach it by adding your drawings to the worldâ€™s largest doodling data set, shared publicly to help with machine learning research. 

Since the release, we've collected over 1 billion drawings across 345 categories. We've [released the data](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) in the form of [very large ndjson files](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset/blob/master/examples/nodejs/ndjson.md) of moderated doodles. Now we are releasing a data API, a Polymer web component, and an option to self-host the 50 million files.

## Run example

With npm installed, in the root of this repo:

```
npm install
npm start
```

When this works, you'll see this simple demo of the component:

![demo image](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-component/raw/master/images/demo.png)


## Usage

Install as an NPM dependency to your project:

```
npm install --save quickdraw-component
```

Import it:

```
import 'quickdraw-component/quickdraw-component.js';
```

*You need to make sure that your app is using a tool like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/configuration/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) to transpile and bundle the component into your app.*

The most basic usage of the component's properties is to include a static, random drawing of a category with an API Key:

```<quick-draw category="apple" key="AIzaSyC0U3yLy_m6u7aOMi9YJL2w1vWG4oI5mj0"></quick-draw>```

A list of all the available categories is [here](./categories.js).

### Getting a demo API Key

It is *highly encouraged* for any large project to not use the demo endpoint as a dependency - see [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting) below.  In order to get an API key for the demo endpoint, you need to:

1. [Join the Quick Draw API Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quick-draw-data-api).

2. In your project on Google Cloud Platform, go to [APIs & Services > Library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/quickdrawfiles.appspot.com) and search for "Quick, Draw! API"

3. Click into Quick, Draw! Data API and press "Enable"

4. If you haven't created an API Key yet for your project, go into [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and create one.  This is what you'll use in the `key` property of: `<quick-draw key="YOUR_API_KEY"></quick-draw>`


### Options

| Name		     | Description | Type		  | Default | Options / Examples|
| :----------- | :-----------:| :-----------:| :-----------:|---------:|
| `category` **required* | One of the [available categories](./categories.js) | String | null | ```<quick-draw category="apple"></quick-draw>```
| `key` **required* | API Key from Google Cloud Platform | String | null | ```<quick-draw key="AIzaSyC0U3yLy_m6u7aOMi9YJL2w1vWG4oI5mj0"></quick-draw>```
| `host` | The host of your API | String | https://quickdrawfiles.appspot.com | ```<quick-draw host="https://quickdrawfiles.appspot.com"></quick-draw>```
| `index` | The drawing id within a category *(random unless specified)* | Number | -1 | ```<quick-draw category="apple" index="3927"></quick-draw>```
| `animate` | Animate the drawing in the same time frame it was originally drawn|  Boolean | *false* |`<quick-draw category="apple" animate></quick-draw>`
| `time` | Sets the total time for the animation, preserving time proportions for each path (in milliseconds)|  Number | null |`<quick-draw category="apple" time="1500" animate></quick-draw>`
| `paused` | When set to true, the component will only load the image data but not draw it. Listen for the data loaded event ```drawingData``` and then call ```drawImage()``` to control it manually|  Number | null |`<quick-draw category="apple" paused animate></quick-draw>`
| `strokeColor` | A hex value for the stroke color |  String | #000000 |`<quick-draw category="apple" strokeColor="#4285f4"></quick-draw>`
| `strokeWidth` | The width/thickness of the stroke |  Number | 4|`<quick-draw category="apple" strokeWidth="1"></quick-draw>`
| `width` | The px width of the drawing. If provided, the drawing will scale proportionally to fit the space. |  String | 'auto'|`<quick-draw category="apple" width="125"></quick-draw>`
| `height` | The px height of the drawing. If provided, the drawing will scale proportionally to fit the space. |  String | 'auto'|`<quick-draw category="apple" height="125"></quick-draw>`
| `debug` | For testing purposes, will log output |  Boolean | false|`<quick-draw category="apple" debug></quick-draw>`


### Events

You can listen for the following custom events from the component:

| Name		    | Description	 | Return       |
| ----------- | :-----------:| :-----------:|
| `drawingData` | When drawing data is received | `{detail: {index, category, data}}`
| `drawingComplete` | When drawing is completed | `{detail: {index, category, data}}`

An example of how to access the element to listen for events:

```
function ready() {
	var el = document.querySelector('quick-draw');
	el.addEventListener('drawingData', function(){
	  console.log('Drawing data loaded...');
	});
	el.addEventListener('drawingComplete', function(){
	  console.log('Drawing complete!');
	});
}
	
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ready);
```

### Methods

You can manually call the following methods on your element:

#### fetchImageData(category, index)
This method will load image data, where "category" is one of [these available categories](./categories.js) like "cat", or "apple", and index is the number of the drawing.  If index isn't passed, then it will load in a random image. To find out exactly how many indices are available for a given category, use the ```/{category}/count``` API call below.  

#### drawImage()
This method will simply draw the image out on the canvas with its current properties.  This is especially useful when using the ```paused``` property (when you want to control exactly when it's drawn out).


## API / Middleware

This component has a server-side dependency, which can be reached from this endpoint:

```https://quickdrawfiles.appspot.com/drawing/{category}?id={id}&key={key}&isAnimated={isAnimated}&format={format}```

| Name		     | Description | Type		  | Default |
| :----------- | :-----------:| :-----------:| -----------:|
| `category` **required* | One of the [available categories](./categories.js) | String | null
| `id` **required* | ID (number) or "random" | String | null
| `key` **required* | API Key ([see above for instructions](#getting-a-demo-api-key)) | String | null
| `isAnimated` | Will return raw time-based data if true, otherwise simplified data | Boolean | false 
| `format` | JSON or canvas drawing | String | "json"

You can also retrieve the total count of drawings within a category using:

```https://quickdrawfiles.appspot.com/drawing/{category}/count?key={key}```


## Self-Hosting

It's highly encouraged that you self-host for larger, more serious projects as the quota limits are subject to change with this one (and it's not guaranteed to be supported / maintained forever).  View the [README.md](./api/README.md) in the API directory to learn more about how to self-host the files and the API.
